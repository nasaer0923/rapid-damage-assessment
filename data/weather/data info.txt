max sustained wind speed
	- "When applied to a particular weather system, refers to the highest one-minute average wind (at an elevation of 10 meters with an unobstructed exposure) associated with that weather system at a particular point in time."

gust
	- "Is a sudden, brief increase in speed of the wind. According to U.S. weather observing practice, gusts are reported when the peak wind speed reaches at least 16 knots and the variation in wind speed between the peaks and lulls is at least 9 knots. The duration of a gust is usually less than 20 seconds"

precipitation
	From metadata.txt:
			Total precipitation (rain and/or melted
                         snow) reported during the day in inches
                         and hundredths; will usually not end 
                         with the midnight observation--i.e., 
                         may include latter part of previous day.
                         .00 indicates no measurable              
                         precipitation (includes a trace).        
                         Missing = 99.99
                         Note:  Many stations do not report '0' on
                         days with no precipitation--therefore,  
                         '99.99' will often appear on these days.
                         Also, for example, a station may only
                         report a 6-hour amount for the period 
                         during which rain fell.
                         See Flag field for source of data.
Flag    124-124   Char   A = 1 report of 6-hour precipitation 
                             amount.
                         B = Summation of 2 reports of 6-hour

                             for the day (eg, from 6-hour reports),
                             but also reported at least one
                             occurrence of precipitation in hourly
                             observations--this could indicate a
                             trace occurred, but should be considered
                             as incomplete data for the day.
                         I = Station did not report any precip data
                             for the day and did not report any
                             occurrences of precipitation in its hourly
                             observations--it's still possible that
                             precip occurred but was not reported.
